Metadata has all the log files, runcards has all the inputfiles, one associates with each simulation sample.

The cross sections are not recorded in the log files. The cross sections as recorded in the output files for each sample are

|                   | Rad=1 cross section (μb) | Rad=0 cross section (μb) |
